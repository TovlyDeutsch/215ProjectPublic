# Phonotactic Language Model

This repo contains code for training and evaluation phonotactic language models for a final project for Linguistics 215 at Harvard: ["Analyzing Phonological Surfeit of the Stimulus in Neural Models"](https://tovly.com/ling_215_squib.pdf).

The code is forked from the [Phonotactic_LM repo](https://github.com/MaxAndrewNelson/Phonotactic_LM) by Mayer and Nelson (2020).
